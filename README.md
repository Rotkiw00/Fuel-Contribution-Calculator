# Xamarin.iOS project called "Zrzuta na WACHE"
The project is the first one I have developed and pushed on GitHub ðŸ”¥. This simple app make it's possible for people to calculate the cost of traveling by car based on: 
- how many people are in the car,
- distance,
- fuel cost,
- milage value,
- average person weight.
